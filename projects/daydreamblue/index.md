## History

A lake and a robot for you and your friends…
 
Such was the original idea for Daydream Blue.  It was 2015, and Richie Hoagland had a problem:  His new VR game wasn’t integrating the new technology as he’d like.  Frustrated, he longed to lie down in a sparse field, look up at the sky, and think--but he was trapped in an urban office.  So he did what any true developer would do...he built a green valley in virtual reality.  He put a sky overhead.  Then he strapped in, closed his eyes, and drifted away.  
 
‘This is it,’ he thought.  ‘This is the feeling of happiness I want to give others.”   

They called it Daydream Blue.  

Daydream Blue is a virtual world, a place where you can customize yourself and your place in it.  It’s a space to be explored and discovered either alone or with friends. A place to build a fire and catch some fish.  Or play some golf.  Play fetch with your robot. Or just wish the clouds out of the sky.

Because in a dream, anything is possible.
