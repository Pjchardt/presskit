## Description

RalphVR creates Virtual Worlds to help people smile.

## History

### Beginning

Richie Hoagland and Shea Rembold founded RalphVR after Daydream Blue, their first virtual reality game, won Gold Prize in the 2015 Oculus Mobile VR Jam.  Wishing to pivot into the still-developing VR market, they  set out to build a new company focused on virtual reality and deep gameplay experience.

RalphVR is the result of their effort.  And RalphVRâ€™s mission is to make people happy.
